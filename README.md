# SecretSanta
If not already done, install python and add to path.

Then modify names.txt to list the names of every member of your secret santa gift exchange [one name per line].

Delete the contents of the subfolder containing the sample name files.

Next open the secretSanta folder in the command line and imput the following command:

python SecretSanta.py

Then distribute the files to the appropriate recipients (the files with their names on them). BE SURE NOT TO PEAK AT SOMEONE ELSE'S FILE!
